# Angular-code-challenge
We would like to put the practical code challenge, which will give us something practical to discuss in the interview rather than purely theoretical. Here are the details for the test:
As a technical test for the interview, we typically ask you to demonstrate your ability to learn new technologies. 
We would like you to prototype a small Web application using Metawidget. You need spend no more than an hour (though you certainly can if you like).
The prototype only needs to be a single page (it can be more if you prefer). It should use some client-side JavaScript (Metawidget supports several) and Metawidget to collect some data, and demonstrate it being saved in some way (either to the console, sent over a REST API, etc). Bonus points for collecting data in a nested structure (such as person->address->city), implementing one-to-many relationships (such as collecting a person's children's names), and other creative enhancements! 
Source code comments are highly regarded.
